# 											Ops!!



# Your service sign-up is almost complete!

Thanks for signing up with Amazon Web Services. Your services may take up to 24 hours to fully activate. If you’re unable to access AWS services after that time, here are a few things you can do to expedite the process:

1. Make sure you provided all necessary information during signup. [Complete your AWS registration.](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?type=resubscribe#/)
2. Check your email to see if you have received any requests for additional information. If you have, please respond to those emails with the information requested.
3. Verify your [credit card information](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentmethods) is correct. Also, check your credit card activity to see if there’s a $1 authorization (this is not a charge). You may need to contact your card issuer to approve the authorization.

If the problem persists, please contact Support:

**Account activated, but waiting for support to return! The project output will be loaded in this folder if the account is activated..**
